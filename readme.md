# Attack of the periwinkles

# Hank's Story

Hank used to be a humble octopus, just minding his own business on the rocky shore he
lived on. He would swim from dawn till dusk in the beautiful green water every day, just enjoying
life. Then, one day the water surface started turning dark and there was hardly any light. Hank started to realize 
there were little creatures showing up. They were small and snail like and had varying
expressions on their faces. Hank had read about these creatures before and soon realized they were
the PERIWINKLES OF PERIL! Help hank defend his home by throwing ink at the Perilful Winlkes!

### Classes
* Octopus -- Hank
* Periwinkels of Peril (Sea Snail) 
* Ink

### Concept of Game
Periwinkles are invading the personal space of Hank the octopus 
and he shoots his Ink at them to make them die/ find somehwere else to live. 
Hank can move from side to side and the periwinkels fall down towards him. If a periwinkle reaches the 
sea bottom the game is over and hank must find a new place to live.
